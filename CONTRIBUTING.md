# Introduction

### What We’re Looking For

There are many ways you can contribute:

- Fix bugs or improve existing code
- Write or improve documentation
- Add beginner-friendly issues (labels like good first issue)
- Suggest or implement new features

# Ground Rules

- Be respectful and constructive in all communication.
- Keep changes small and focused on one feature or fix per pull request.
- Discuss major changes in an Issue before coding.
- Make sure code compiles without errors or warnings.

# Your First Contribution

If you’re new, here are some easy ways to start:

- Look for issues labeled good first issue.
- Improve documentation or add comments to clarify tricky parts of the code.
- Test the project on your machine and report problems you find.

# Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork and create a new branch for your work
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a clear message
5. Push your branch and open a Pull Request

Example:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LearnBankUI.git
cd LearnBankUI
git checkout -b my-feature
# make changes now. then:
git commit -m "Add feature X"
git push origin my-feature
```

# How to report a bug

If you find a security issue, please do not open an issue. Instead, email loelle@hawaii.edu privately.

For regular bugs, open a GitHub Issue and include:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Your operating system and compiler version

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Open a GitHub Issue and describe:

- The problem your feature would solve
- Why it would be useful for this project
- How you imagine it could work

# Code review process

- All pull requests are reviewed by a maintainer.
- Feedback may be requested. Please be open to discussion.
- Small, well-documented changes are more likely to be merged quickly.

# Community

All communication happens through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. If you need help, open an Issue and describe clearly what you need assistance with.
